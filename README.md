# aecontracts

# Introduction 
This project contains the code necessary to conduct a pre-sale NFT. It consists of two main contracts. First contract is the NFT itself.
Second contract is used to conduct the pre-sale. Tokens available are minted prior to the event taking place.

# Getting Started

More details about the process can be found on the documentation page https://aeproject.gitbook.io/aeproject/

Steps to deploy the contracts consist of two parts. First the NFT contract must be deployed because the address is needed for initializing the pre-sale contract.
After that step the pre-sale contract can be deployed and initialized and the contract owner can mint the needed NFT tokens.
